## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

- **Frontend**: User and admin interfaces (UI layer not included in this repository)
- **Backend**: Stateless Lambda functions handling document upload, validation, and session token verification
- **Storage**: Amazon S3 for document storage with pre-signed URL support
- **Authentication**: Amazon Cognito for secure user sign-in and token handling
- **Notification Layer**: Amazon SNS for alerting users about document verification events
- **Infrastructure**: 
  - Docker-based development and Lambda testing
  - EC2 instances for isolated deployment environments
  - IAM policies for role-based access
  - CloudWatch and AWS Budgets for usage monitoring and cost tracking


----
The project leverages the AWS Cloud Platform, with Python as the core backend language. AWS Lambda functions manage document verification workflows and authentication logic, while Amazon S3 securely stores uploaded files using pre-signed URLs. User authentication and session control are handled via Amazon Cognito. Notification workflows are implemented using Amazon SNS. For deployment and backend testing, Docker is used in combination with Amazon EC2. Infrastructure security and permissions are managed through AWS IAM, and system monitoring and budget tracking are performed using AWS CloudWatch and AWS Budgets. GitHub is used for version control and collaboration throughout the development cycle.
